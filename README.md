# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

The project will perform an exploratory analysis on data in some very large csv file. To aid this process, serveral types of visualizations will be created to tell a compelling story about the data. The Juperter Notebook and Matplotlib will be used to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city, and the number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. the analysis and visulizations will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
